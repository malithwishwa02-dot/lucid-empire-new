# LUCID EMPIRE v5.0 TRANSFORMATION REPORT

## Summary
- Manual Takeover Protocol, Genesis Engine, Python Lobotomy, Biometric Mimicry, and Network Sovereignty are now wired end-to-end across the camoufox project for deterministic identity replication.
- The workflow covers Fabrication → Genesis → Maturity → Takeover → Action with dedicated tooling for profile stores, GUI triggers, and the hardened browser binary.

## Modified Files
1. `lucid_manager.py` – GUI controls for profile lifecycle, Genesis init, and the takeover trigger.
2. `lucid_launcher.py` – Manual Takeover orchestrator with proxy injection, template/environment loading, and isolated Firefox boot.
3. `core/genesis_engine.py` – Genesis lifecycle automation with libfaketime, persona scheduling, trust-anchor navigation, and commerce timing.
4. `pythonlib/lucid_browser/sync_api.py` – Python Lobotomy enforcing validated golden templates and deterministic fingerprint vectors.
5. `modules/biometric_mimicry.py` – GAN/S-curve mouse movement, keystroke rhythm, and scroll injection to defeat behavioral biometrics.
6. `network/xdp_outbound.c` – eBPF TCP rewrite that spoofs TTL/window size and recalculates checksums to match Windows 10 fingerprints.
