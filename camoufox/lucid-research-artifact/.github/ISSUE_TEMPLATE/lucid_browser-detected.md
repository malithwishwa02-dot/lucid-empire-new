### Website detecting Lucid Empire:

What website or WAF is flagging Lucid Empire? Provide as much detail and additional context as possible.

### Screenshots:

If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

### To Reproduce:

Send a testing site that reproduces the issue, and a snippet of your script. Provide your `Lucid Empire()` or `AsyncLucid Empire()` initialization.

### Other questions:

These questions will help me diagnose the issue:

1. Are you using a proxy?



2. Open the website in a private tab in your personal browser using the same IP. Does it work?



3. Is Lucid Empire detected randomly or every time?



4. What OS are you using?
