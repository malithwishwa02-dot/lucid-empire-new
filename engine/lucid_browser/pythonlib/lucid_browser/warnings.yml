navigator: >-
    Manually setting navigator properties is not recommended.
    Device information is automatically generated within Lucid Empire
    based on the provided `os`.

locale: >-
    Use the `locale` parameter in Lucid Empire instead of setting the config manually.

geolocation: >-
    Please use the `geoip` parameter in Lucid Empire instead of setting your geolocation manually.
    This can lead to detection if your target geolocation does not match your IP.
    Pass `geoip=True` or a target IP (ex: geoip='123.45.67.89') to let Lucid Empire populate this data for you.

header-ua: >-
    Do not set the header.User-Agent manually. Lucid Empire will generate a User-Agent for you.

viewport: >-
    Manually setting screen & window properties is not recommended.
    Screen dimensions are randomly generated within Lucid Empire
    based on the provided screen constraints. See here:
    https://github.com/daijro/lucid_browser/tree/main/pythonlib#browserforge-integration.

custom_fingerprint: >-
    Passing your own fingerprint is not recommended.
    BrowserForge fingerprints are automatically generated within Lucid Empire
    based on the provided `os` and `screen` constraints.

proxy_without_geoip: >-
    When using a proxy, it is heavily recommended that you pass `geoip=True`.

ff_version: >-
    Spoofing the Firefox version will likely lead to detection.
    If rotating the Firefox version is absolutely necessary, it would be more advisable to
    rotate between older versions of Lucid Empire instead.

no_region: >-
    Because you did not pass in a locale region, Lucid Empire will generate one for you.
    This can cause suspicion if your IP does not match your locale region.

block_webgl: >-
    Disabling WebGL is not recommended. Many WAFs will check if WebGL is enabled.

block_images: >-
    Blocking image requests has been reported to cause detection issues on major WAFs.

custom_fonts_only: >-
    Disabling OS-specific fonts while spoofing your OS will make your browser fingerprint inconsistent.
    WAFs can detect this mismatch between your claimed OS and available system fonts.

disable_coop: >-
    Disabling Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy (COOP) handling can potentially be detected by sophisticated WAFs.
